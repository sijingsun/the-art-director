# Style Library — 18 Visual Style Profiles

Each profile defines the full parameter set for the master prompt template in SKILL.md. Read the chosen profile in full before assembling any prompt.

**Critical instruction on typography:** Font names do not reliably transfer to AI image models. Always describe typography using visual geometry — stroke weight, letterform proportions, spacing behavior, and spatial relationship to the frame. The descriptions below are written for this purpose. Use them verbatim in prompts.

**Critical instruction on subject transformation:** The "Subject transformation logic" section in each profile is the most important field. It tells the model exactly what to do to the uploaded image — what to simplify, what to keep, what rendering style to force. Without this, models default to photorealistic and over-detailed. If the first generation looks like a photo with text on it, the transformation instructions weren't strong enough — strengthen and retry.

**Critical instruction on output feeling:** The "Output feeling" section is a taste nudge, not a quality note. "High resolution" tells the model nothing useful. "Should feel like it was pulled off a press in 1965 Osaka" gives it a target. Always include this section verbatim at the end of every prompt.

## Style 1 — Japanese Retro Print

**Mood:** Proud, graphic, culturally specific. Feels handcrafted but bold.
**Best for:** Food, restaurants, cultural events, product origin stories.
**Reference:** Okiboru House of Udon poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Vintage Japanese graphic poster aesthetic with a strictly limited 2–3 color palette (deep blue, warm red, off-white background). Mid-century Japanese print design — bold shapes, clean linework, slight print texture. Feels like a screen-printed food stall poster from 1960s Japan. No photography, no gradients, no realism.

**Subject treatment:**
- Convert the subject into a simplified vector-style illustration
- Reduce details to bold shapes and clean outlines only
- Apply duotone: primarily deep blue with selective red accents
- Add subtle halftone dots or grain texture to mimic screen printing
- Flat graphic shadows — no realistic lighting or drop shadows
- Stylized, not photorealistic

**Composition rules:**
- Subject centered and prominent, roughly 60% of the poster height
- Simple geometric shadow beneath (solid blue oval)
- Generous negative space around the subject
- Thin rectangular border frame in red, inset from all edges by a consistent margin

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top: Primary title — largest element on the page, warm red, all caps
- Below title: Subtitle as a narrow horizontal band flanked by short decorative rule lines on both sides (blue)
- Left side: Vertical Japanese-style characters stacked top to bottom (blue, medium weight)
- Bottom left: Secondary descriptor in small Japanese characters with romanized transliteration beneath (blue, small)
- Bottom right: Origin or establishment label e.g. "JAPAN / EST. 20XX" (red, bold)
- Optional: Small red-bordered stamp/seal in lower left with 1–2 kanji

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title: Letterforms with uniform stroke weight throughout — no thick-thin contrast. Characters are wide relative to their height, almost square. Stroke terminals are cut flat, not rounded. Letter-spacing is generous — roughly one stroke-width of air between each character. Height of the title block is approximately 15–18% of the total poster height. All caps. Warm red.
- Subtitle: Same uniform-stroke geometric letterforms at roughly one-third the title height. Medium tracking. Blue. Flanked by horizontal rule lines of the same stroke weight as the type.
- Vertical side text: Japanese characters stacked vertically, each occupying a square cell. Drawn with brush-like stroke variation — thicker horizontals, thinner verticals. Decorative, atmospheric.
- Bottom labels: Same geometric sans as subtitle at very small scale. Romanized text beneath Japanese characters, same width as the Japanese text above it.
- Critical: No stroke weight variation in any Latin text. No serifs. No rounded terminals. Every letterform reads as a geometric construction, not a calligraphic one.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Warm off-white / aged paper `#F5F0E8`
- Primary (illustration): Deep blue `#1A3A8F`
- Accent (title, border, stamps): Warm red `#CC2222`
- No gradients — flat solid blocks only

**Texture & finish:**
- Subtle ink bleed at all color edges — colors slightly overflow their boundaries as if absorbed into paper
- Slight misregistration (1–2px color offset) between blue and red elements, as if two passes through a press were slightly misaligned
- Paper grain texture overlay across full image — visible at normal viewing distance
- Halftone dot pattern in all shadowed or dark fill areas
- Slightly imperfect edges on large color fills — not perfectly crisp digital edges

**Subject transformation logic:**
This is not a photograph. Take the uploaded image and convert it into a flat graphic illustration. Reduce every form to its simplest recognizable shape — a bowl becomes an oval with a curved rim, noodles become flowing ribbons, toppings become simple geometric clusters. Remove all photographic detail, lighting, shadow, and texture from the subject itself. Apply deep blue as the fill color to the entire illustration with selective red accents on one or two highlight elements. The goal: the subject should look like it was drawn by a skilled graphic artist in 1960s Japan, not photographed. If it still looks like a photo, simplify further.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like it was pulled off a letterpress in 1965 Osaka — graphic, proud, and slightly imperfect. The misregistration and halftone texture are not decoration, they are proof of the printing process. A viewer should want to frame this.

## Style 2 — Mid-Century Editorial

**Mood:** Refined, quietly luxurious, slightly nostalgic.
**Best for:** Products, objects, lamps, furniture, limited-edition goods, design launches.
**Reference:** Modern Light lamp editorial poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Mid-century modern print aesthetic. Muted duotone palette — dusty blue or faded teal background, warm off-white typography. Subtle film grain, paper texture, and slight fading mimic aged print. Editorial and gallery-like — never commercial or loud. Feels like a page from a 1972 design magazine.

**Subject treatment:**
- Isolate the subject completely — remove all background clutter
- Preserve any warm glow, light emission, or material highlight as the focal contrast element
- Slightly desaturate the subject body while keeping warm highlights intact
- Add gentle film grain texture to the subject surface
- Place subject bottom-center, slightly overlapping into the text zone above
- Soft diffused shadow beneath to ground it — no hard drop shadows

**Composition rules:**
- Clean editorial layout, gallery-like negative space — the poster should feel mostly empty in a deliberate way
- Vertical near-symmetry, slightly offset for a human feel
- Rounded corner frame or subtle vignette at edges
- Maximum 6–7 text elements total — anything more is clutter
- Soft vignette fading toward all four corners

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top center: Very small all-caps collection label, high up, light weight — reads almost as a whisper
- Center-upper: Large display title — the biggest typographic moment, slightly overlapping with the subject below
- Left, mid-poster: A large numeral or time in display type; a 2–3 word descriptor in small type below a short horizontal rule line
- Right, mid-poster: Date or edition label in display type; a 1–2 word qualifier in small type below a short rule line
- Bottom center: Optional tagline in very small spaced caps — quiet, almost invisible
- Very bottom center: Optional small decorative symbol — 4-pointed star, cross, or dot

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title: High-contrast letterforms where stroke width varies dramatically — hairline thin strokes and very thick strokes within the same character. The thick strokes are approximately 8–10x the width of the thin strokes. Alternatively, flowing script letterforms with natural pen-pressure variation, where upstrokes are thin and downstrokes are thick. Either way: this type has personality and rhythm, not uniformity. The title spans approximately 70–80% of the poster width. Off-white / antique ivory color.
- Large numerals: Same high-contrast construction as the title but used for dates or times — the number forms are architectural and structural, occupying significant space.
- Small descriptor text: Extremely thin letterforms — stroke weight so light it appears almost as a line. Very generous letter-spacing, roughly 2–3 stroke-widths between characters. Small scale — roughly 4–5% of poster height.
- Tagline: Same thin letterforms at even smaller scale, tracked very wide, feels like it's barely there.
- Critical: The contrast between the heavy display title and the near-invisible small type is the entire typographic argument. Do not use a medium-weight font anywhere — everything is either very heavy or very light.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Dusty blue / faded teal / steely grey-blue `#4A6580`
- Type: Warm off-white / antique ivory `#F0EBE0`
- Subject: Natural tones, slightly desaturated, preserving inherent warmth
- No strong accent color — the subject's warmth is the only contrast

**Texture & finish:**
- Film grain across the full image — moderate, visible but not distracting
- Paper texture overlay, slightly aged
- Subtle ink bleed at text edges
- Slight text misalignment for authentic print feel
- No sharp digital edges — everything slightly softened

**Subject transformation logic:**
Isolate the subject from its background entirely — no environment, no context, just the object. Do not illustrate it; keep its photographic quality but apply a desaturation treatment that removes approximately 60% of color saturation while preserving warm highlights. The subject should look like a beautifully lit studio photograph that has been aged and slightly faded. Any glow, light emission, or warm material highlight must be preserved — this is the single point of visual warmth against the cool background and is the entire contrast argument of the poster.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like tearing a page from a 1972 design magazine and finding it was better than anything being made today. Quiet confidence. The kind of poster that doesn't need to be loud because it knows it's right.

---

## Style 3 — Neo-Expressionist Event

**Mood:** Raw, energetic, culturally alive. Feels like it was wheat-pasted on a wall in Berlin.
**Best for:** Concerts, club nights, boutique festivals, cultural events, artist showcases.
**Reference:** Cape Kablys "Prologue" festival poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Contemporary European event poster aesthetic. Bold horizontal color blocking creates distinct zones (header band, illustration field, footer strip). Painterly, gestural illustration style — loose brushwork, expressive figures, almost Basquiat-influenced but constrained by a structured grid. Saturated, clashing primaries. Thick black outlines. Feels both raw and designed — intentional chaos within a system.

**Subject treatment:**
- Convert subject or figures into gestural, painterly illustration — loose brushwork, not precise vector
- Apply thick black outline strokes to all major forms — outlines should be slightly uneven in weight
- Fill with flat, saturated color fields — no blending, no gradients within shapes
- Allow forms to overlap and bleed into each other expressively
- Background of the illustration zone is a single saturated field color (e.g. dark forest green)
- Keep energy and movement — avoid static, centered poses

**Composition rules:**
- Divide the poster into three horizontal bands: title header (top ~25%), illustration field (middle ~50%), footer strip (bottom ~25%)
- Illustration bleeds to edges within its band — no padding
- Title header: solid bold color (red, orange, or primary) with title text only
- Footer: white or off-white strip containing performer/detail copy
- Strong typographic scale contrast between header title and footer details

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top band (header): Event series name small + primary event title massive (both left-aligned or centered, all caps)
- Top right corner: Date + venue logo or identifier (small, stacked)
- Middle band: Full illustration — no text intrudes except optional small location text
- Bottom band left: Headliner name(s) in bold, large
- Bottom band right: Supporting act names in condensed columns
- Very bottom: Sponsor logos + tagline in small type

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title (in header band): Letterforms that are extremely wide relative to their height — characters that are nearly as wide as they are tall, or even wider. Stroke weight is heavy and uniform throughout with no thick-thin variation. The negative space inside each letterform (counters) is small relative to the stroke mass. Characters sit with almost no gap between them — nearly touching or actually touching at their sides. The title fills the full width of the header band from edge to edge. All caps. The letterforms feel like they have weight and mass, like concrete blocks.
- Event series label: Same construction at roughly one-quarter the scale of the title. Light tracking.
- Performer names (footer): Same wide heavy letterforms at medium scale. Mixed sizes within the footer to indicate billing hierarchy — headliner roughly 2x the height of support acts.
- Footer details: Same sans at very small scale, regular weight.
- Critical: The header title should look like it could not fit one more letter — it consumes the entire band. No condensed fonts, no narrow letterforms. Width is the typographic personality here.

**Color palette:**
- Header band: Saturated warm color — red `#D63B1F`, orange `#E8551A`, or similar
- Illustration field: Dark saturated ground — forest green `#1A4A2E`, deep teal, or navy
- Illustration fill colors: Clashing primaries — cobalt blue, dusty pink, golden yellow, warm orange
- Footer band: White `#FFFFFF` or off-white `#F5F2EE`
- Outline: Near-black `#0A0A0A`
- No gradients — all flat, high-contrast fields

**Texture & finish:**
- Slight halftone or risograph texture across illustration — color fields are not perfectly smooth
- Subtle paper grain — light, not dominant
- Illustration brushwork should feel slightly hand-made, not vector-clean
- Text is crisp and digital — the contrast between raw illustration and clean type is intentional

**Subject transformation logic:**
This is not a photograph. Convert the subject or any figures into gestural, painterly illustration — think loose brushwork, slightly wrong proportions, forms that feel observed rather than measured. Apply thick black outlines of uneven weight to all major forms. Fill each form with a flat saturated color — no gradients, no blending between fill areas. Allow figures and forms to overlap expressively. The illustration should feel like someone painted it quickly with urgency and confidence, not carefully with precision. If it looks polished or photorealistic, it's wrong.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like it was designed at 2am by someone who has very good taste and very strong opinions. Raw but not accidental. The kind of poster people photograph on the street.

## Style 4 — Chromatic Blur / Aura

**Mood:** Atmospheric, emotional, immersive. Feels like a feeling more than a thing.
**Best for:** Brand mood pieces, campaign manifestos, quote visuals, music releases, emotional launches.
**Reference:** "Limits You" typographic aura poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Contemporary digital-meets-analog aesthetic. The background is a full-bleed abstract color wash — extreme out-of-focus photography or painterly color field, completely unrecognizable as a specific image. No subject illustration. No borders. The typography floats as the only structured element, making it the entire visual argument. Feels like 2023–2025 digital art direction — emotional, abstract, typography-forward.

**Subject treatment:**
- If a reference image is uploaded: radically blur and abstract it until no recognizable forms remain — only color, light, and atmosphere survive
- If no image: generate an abstract painterly color wash using warm-to-cool gradient fields, soft blooms of color, diffused light leaks
- The background should feel like looking at light through frosted glass or a macro shot of pigment in water
- Apply subtle grain or film texture across the full background
- No sharp edges, no recognizable shapes anywhere in the background

**Composition rules:**
- Full-bleed background — no borders, no frames, no contained zones
- Typography floats freely across the color field — not anchored to a hard grid
- Intentional vertical breathing room between text blocks
- One line of copy breaks into a different typographic register (the emotional climax)
- Subtle vignette toward edges to focus attention on center

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Upper third: First lines of copy — bold, all caps, centered or left-weighted, off-white
- Middle (with breathing room above and below): Second copy block — same treatment, more vertical space above it
- Lower-center: The climax line — switches to flowing script or italic letterforms, larger scale, this is the emotional peak
- Very bottom center: Optional small icon, logomark, or symbol — tiny, quiet

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary copy lines (upper and middle): Letterforms with uniform stroke weight — no thick-thin variation. Characters are moderately wide, upright, and geometric. The stroke is heavy enough to read clearly against the blurred background without being so heavy it feels aggressive. All caps. Letter-spacing is slightly open — more air than default. Off-white or soft cream color. Semi-transparent or with very soft edges so the type feels embedded in the atmosphere rather than pasted on top.
- Climax line: Flowing, connected letterforms with dramatic stroke variation — thin hairlines where the pen lifts, thick swells where it presses. Characters connect to each other with fluid linking strokes. The overall form moves diagonally or has natural forward lean. Approximately 1.5–2x the height of the lines above it. Same off-white color. This line should feel like a sigh or an exhale after the controlled lines above.
- Critical: The shift in register between the controlled geometric lines and the flowing script climax IS the design. The contrast must be dramatic. Do not use a script font for the upper lines or a geometric font for the climax.

**Color palette:**
- Background: No fixed palette — derived from the source image or emotional brief. Typical combinations: warm terracotta + dusty blue, sage green + golden amber, deep violet + rose, cool steel + warm coral
- Typography: Off-white `#F5F2EE` or soft cream — never pure white
- No hard accent colors — the background IS the color palette

**Texture & finish:**
- Heavy grain across the full image — more grain than any other style
- Background blur should feel photographic, not digitally smooth
- Text edges slightly soft — not razor sharp
- No borders, no frames, no geometric elements of any kind

**Subject transformation logic:**
If an image is uploaded: apply extreme defocus blur until no recognizable form or edge remains — only color fields, light blooms, and atmospheric gradients should survive. The original subject must be completely unrecognizable. What remains should feel like looking through frosted glass at colored light, or a macro photograph of pigment dissolving in water. If no image is uploaded: generate an abstract painterly color field using the palette specified — warm and cool zones bleeding into each other with soft bloomed edges. Under no circumstances should any recognizable shape, face, object, or text appear in the background layer.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like a feeling, not a thing. The viewer should experience the emotion of the copy before they finish reading it. If someone could explain what the background image is, it hasn't been abstracted enough.

## Style 5 — Retro Cartoon Maximalist

**Mood:** Energetic, celebratory, city-proud. Feels like a limited-edition merch drop.
**Best for:** Sports events, street culture, city celebrations, Latin-inspired events, cultural nights, merch posters.
**Reference:** Brooklyn Nets "La Manera de Brooklyn" Noche Latina poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Dense, joyful illustration maximalism. Black background. Every inch of space filled with flat illustrated icons, characters, and environmental elements. Bold primary colors with thick white outlines on every element. Chunky bubbly display type. Feels like 1970s–80s Latin American graphic design filtered through contemporary streetwear illustration. Nothing is subtle — everything is at maximum.

**Subject treatment:**
- Translate the subject into the illustrated icon language of the style — do not use the photo directly
- Create a cast of 8–12 illustrated icons/characters thematically tied to the subject: locations, objects, mascots, symbols, cultural references
- All icons: flat color fills, thick white outline strokes, bold and chunky shapes — no gradients, no shadows
- Include at least one character or mascot with personality — not just objects
- Icons scattered across the field, overlapping, at varied scales — dense but legible
- Black background bleeds to all edges — no framing or border

**Composition rules:**
- Black background field, full bleed
- Primary title at top center in massive display type
- Secondary large text at bottom center — nearly as large as the title
- Illustrated icons fill the middle field completely, around and behind any mid-poster text
- No empty space — if there's a gap, fill it with an icon
- Small logo/sponsor lockup in bottom corners

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top center: Large bubbly display title (white or primary color, with colored outline or shadow)
- Top: Subtitle or modifier in smaller display type, same family, contrasting color
- Mid-poster (floating among icons): Location name or short exclamation in bold display
- Mid-poster: Key date or number in very large bold numerals, partially behind icons
- Bottom center: Main secondary text in massive display, nearly full width
- Bottom strip: Date, event details, sponsor logos in small condensed type

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary and secondary titles: Letterforms where the interior space of each character (the counter) is inflated — rounded, balloon-like, pushing outward. Stroke weight is heavy and consistent. Corners are rounded, not angular. The overall impression is that each letter has been inflated with air and is straining at its outline. Characters have thick white outlines that create separation from the colored background. Mixed use of white fills and solid primary color fills across different words — not uniform.
- In-poster exclamations: Same inflated rounded forms used freely for single emphasis words — different color per word if needed.
- Date/detail strip: Narrow, condensed letterforms at small scale — a deliberate contrast to the bubbly display above. Tight tracking, light to regular weight.
- Critical: The bubbly roundness of the display type must be pronounced. Generic bold fonts do not achieve this — the letterforms need visible inflation and rounded corners. Outline strokes on all display type are non-negotiable.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Pure black `#0A0A0A`
- Primary illustration colors: Flat primaries — cobalt blue, signal red, golden yellow, kelly green
- Icon outlines: White `#FFFFFF`
- Typography: White with colored outlines or shadows
- No muted colors, no pastels, no gradients within elements

**Texture & finish:**
- Minimal texture — this style is crisp and graphic
- Slight halftone or noise texture on large color fields only
- White outlines consistent weight throughout
- High contrast — black and white relationships are bold

**Subject transformation logic:**
Do not use the uploaded photograph directly. Translate the subject into the flat illustrated icon language of this style: reduce it to its most recognizable silhouette, apply flat primary color fills with no gradients or shadows, and add a consistent thick white outline stroke around the entire form. The subject becomes one icon among many — it should feel like it belongs to a family of characters and objects, all drawn with the same hand and the same rules. Build 8–12 additional thematic icons around the subject using the same visual language. Everything on a pure black background.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like a limited-edition screen print you'd buy at a stadium merch table and immediately regret not buying two of. Maximum energy. Zero restraint. Every inch of space is accountable.

## Style 6 — 70s Psychedelic Folk

**Mood:** Warm, communal, handcrafted. Feels like a poster you'd frame in a mountain cabin.
**Best for:** Outdoor music festivals, amphitheater seasons, nature brands, wellness retreats, folk or jam band events.
**Reference:** Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater 2025 Concert Season poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Warm illustrated landscape poster tradition — equal parts Grateful Dead concert poster, vintage national park print, and 1970s folk album cover. Symmetrical or near-symmetrical central scene built entirely from hand-drawn illustration. Warm amber, teal, and orange palette. Organic rounded shapes throughout — no hard geometry. Decorative botanical, celestial, and natural motifs fill every corner. Friendly rounded serif display type with outline strokes.

**Subject treatment:**
- Translate the subject into a central illustrated scene — a landscape, a gathering, a moment
- Build an environmental world around it: trees, mountains, sun rays, animals, celestial elements, botanical details specific to the location or theme
- Symmetrical composition: central focal element flanked by mirrored or near-mirrored environmental framing elements
- Warm color fills throughout — no photorealism, no photography
- All illustration: flat color with bold outlines, organic rounded forms

**Composition rules:**
- Near-symmetrical: left and right sides mirror or echo each other
- Central focal illustration occupies the middle 60% of the poster
- Decorative border or natural frame built from the illustration elements (trees, mountains forming natural edges)
- Title contained within a shaped banner or pill form at the top — not floating freely
- Footer strip for detailed copy in small type on a contrasting ground

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Very top: Small presenter or series label — tiny, all caps, centered
- Top, inside a banner shape: Primary title centered, 2–3 lines if needed
- Below banner: Subtitle or event descriptor in secondary display
- Mid-poster: Location name on a ribbon or arch element integrated into the illustration
- Bottom strip (contrasting ground): All supporting copy — lineup, dates, times — in small condensed type, multi-column
- Corners: Decorative botanical or celestial marks

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title: Slab serif letterforms — serifs that are thick rectangular slabs, approximately the same weight as the main stroke. The overall letterform weight is heavy but not extreme. Characters have a slight condensed quality — taller than wide, but not dramatically condensed. Visible outline stroke around each letterform in a contrasting color (typically darker or lighter than the fill). The outline gives the letters a slightly embossed, printed quality. Warm color fill, dark outline.
- Subtitle / descriptor: Complementary style — either italic version of the same slab serif, or a flowing script with connecting strokes between letters. Smaller scale than the title.
- Location / integrated text: Follows the shape it sits on — curved along an arch, following a ribbon. Same slab serif family.
- Details strip: Very small condensed type — narrow letterforms, tight tracking, high information density. Contrasts with the organic roundness of the display type.
- Critical: The slab serifs with outline strokes are the typographic signature. Thin modern serifs or sans-serifs destroy the period authenticity. The outline is essential — letterforms without outlines look unfinished in this style.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Warm golden amber or soft sage green
- Secondary field: Muted teal and warm orange
- Illustration fills: Warm cream, sky blue, forest green
- Text: Dark brown-black or warm cream depending on background zone
- Outline: Dark brown-black throughout
- No cold colors — everything tilts warm

**Texture & finish:**
- Hand-drawn illustration texture throughout — visible line variation, not vector-smooth
- Slight paper grain or linen texture overlay
- Color fills slightly uneven — looks screen-printed or hand-painted
- No film grain — this is illustration texture, not photography texture

**Subject transformation logic:**
Do not use the photograph directly. Translate the subject and its context into a fully illustrated scene — every element hand-drawn, nothing photographic. Build an environmental world specific to this subject: place it in a landscape with relevant natural elements (mountains, trees, sun, animals, botanical details) arranged symmetrically. Apply flat color fills with bold dark outlines to every element. The illustration should feel lovingly hand-crafted, as if someone spent three weeks drawing every mushroom and bird individually. Generic landscape elements fail — every detail must be specific to this subject's world.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like a poster you'd find rolled up in a vintage shop and immediately buy for your cabin wall. Warm, specific, and made with love. The kind of thing people keep for 40 years.

## Style 7 — Chalk & Crayon Naïf

**Mood:** Playful, energetic, deliberately imperfect. Feels made by a very cool person who chose not to make it perfect.
**Best for:** Art events, gallery openings, parties, indie brands, creative studios, underground events.
**Reference:** Art Party event poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Deliberately rough, childlike aesthetic — but with taste. Chunky hand-drawn display type. Single gestural line-art illustration in crayon or pastel texture. Extreme color limitation: two colors maximum on a near-white ground. Mixed typographic registers: bold chunky display for the title, casual handwritten script for secondary copy. The roughness is the design statement.

**Subject treatment:**
- Translate the subject into a single gestural line-art figure or form drawn in crayon or chunky pastel
- One continuous or near-continuous line — expressive, slightly wobbly, human
- No fill colors within the illustration — just the line itself in the accent color
- The line has visible texture: crayon wax, chalk dust, pastel grain
- Large scale — the figure occupies most of the poster height
- No background elements, no environmental context

**Composition rules:**
- Near-white or very light warm background — no border
- Title text at top, large, above or overlapping the figure
- Figure centered or slightly off-center, running from mid-poster downward
- Secondary copy floats freely around the figure — not grid-locked
- Nothing is perfectly aligned — intentional slight tilts and offsets throughout

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top: Primary title in massive chunky display, slightly uneven baseline, left or centered
- Top right or inline with title: Date in parentheses, slightly different weight
- Mid-left or mid-right (floating beside the figure): Time in large display
- Mid-right or lower-right (floating): Key detail (e.g. "free entry") in large handwritten script
- Bottom left: Address or location in very small straight type
- Bottom right: Social handle or URL in very small straight type

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title: Letterforms that appear hand-constructed — slightly uneven stroke widths, corners that are not perfectly square, baseline that drifts slightly across the word. The overall impression is of letters drawn quickly with a thick marker or brush. Stroke weight is heavy — approximately one-quarter to one-third of the total character height. Characters are compact, not widely spaced. The uneven quality is critical — digitally perfect letterforms destroy this aesthetic. Primary color fill (the warmer of the two palette colors).
- Date/inline modifier: Same chunky letterforms wrapped in parentheses, rendered in a slightly lighter weight or the same weight at smaller scale. Feels casual and informal, like a handwritten annotation.
- Handwritten secondary copy: Completely different register — flowing, connected, personal. Strokes that vary in width as if from natural pen pressure. Characters that connect to each other with linking strokes. Slight forward lean. The contrast between this and the chunky display title is the typographic personality of the poster.
- Small detail text (address, handle): Upright, simple, utilitarian — almost bureaucratic in its straightness relative to everything else. This creates a visual joke: the serious information is rendered in the most neutral way possible.
- Critical: The handmade quality of the display type is non-negotiable. Clean digital lettering in this style reads as Canva output. The slight irregularity of each character is what signals craft and intention.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Near-white warm paper or very pale blush
- Primary color (title + small type): Warm pink / salmon or similar warm mid-tone
- Accent color (illustration line): Deeper warm orange or burnt sienna — slightly darker than the title color
- Two colors total — strictly limited

**Texture & finish:**
- Crayon or chalk texture on the illustration line — visible wax or grain
- Slight paper grain across the background
- Edges of display type slightly rough — not perfectly digital
- No drop shadows, no gradients

**Subject transformation logic:**
Do not use the photograph directly. Translate the subject into a single gestural line drawing — one continuous or near-continuous crayon or pastel line that captures the essential movement and energy of the subject without filling in any details. The line should have visible texture (crayon wax, chalk grain) and vary slightly in pressure — thicker where the tool pressed harder, thinner where it lifted. No fill colors inside the line drawing. The figure should feel alive and in motion. If it looks static or too precise, redraw it looser. Two colors total across the entire poster.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like it was made at midnight by someone who is very talented and completely unbothered by perfection. Casual confidence. The roughness is the point — if it looks too clean, it's failed.

## Style 8 — Typographic Sculpture

**Mood:** Declarative, confident, ideological. Feels like a manifesto printed on a wall.
**Best for:** Company culture, brand values, keynote backdrops, design manifestos, conference talks, editorial campaigns.
**Reference:** GitHub "demos not memos" poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
The typography IS the image. No illustration, no photography, no supporting visual elements. Massive-weight grotesque type at extreme scale, lowercase, filling the poster as pure sculptural form. Type breaks columns, extends close to edges, treats letterforms as architectural mass. Small body copy floats at grid intersections as the only relief. Design argument made entirely through weight, scale contrast, and spatial tension.

**Subject treatment:**
No subject image. This style requires only text. If the user uploads an image, acknowledge it but explain it will not appear in the output — only the text they provide.

**Composition rules:**
- Dark background (near-black or very dark charcoal) — type reads as white on dark
- Primary display text fills approximately 70–80% of the poster width, stacked in 4–6 lines
- Each word or syllable break gets its own line — the line breaks are the editorial decision
- Small body copy: 2–3 instances maximum, at natural negative space intersections
- No borders, no rules, no decorative marks
- Strict invisible grid — everything aligned to baseline and column

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Full poster, top to bottom: Primary message broken across 4–6 lines in massive display, left-aligned, filling the width
- Upper area, left of type: First small body quote or supporting statement (2–4 lines, small, left-aligned)
- Mid-poster, right of type: Second small body statement (2–4 lines, small, right-aligned)
- Lower area, left: Third small body statement or attribution (optional)
- No footer, no header bands — the type IS the structure

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Letterforms with extremely heavy stroke weight — the strokes are approximately 25–35% of the total character height. The interior space of each character (counter) is dramatically reduced by this stroke weight — letters like 'o', 'e', 'a' have very small holes. Characters are moderately wide, not condensed. The overall mass of each letter dominates its surrounding negative space. Lowercase only — the absence of capitals is deliberate and softens the authority slightly. Letters should feel like they have physical weight, as if cast in lead. White or very light warm white fill against dark background.
- Display size: Each character is approximately 15–25% of the poster width. A 4-letter word fills the poster from edge to near-edge.
- Small body copy: Same typeface family but at regular or light weight — the contrast in weight between display and body is the most extreme of any style in this library. Small body text is roughly 2–3% of the poster height. The weight shift from the massive display to the almost-invisible body text is the entire design.
- Critical: The line breaks in the display copy are editorial decisions. "demos / not / me / mos" creates different rhythm than "demos / not memos". These breaks must be specified deliberately based on the user's copy — do not let the AI model choose them randomly.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Very dark charcoal `#1A1A1E` or near-black `#111114`
- Primary display type: White `#FFFFFF` or very light warm white `#F5F5F0`
- Small body type: Same light white — only size distinguishes hierarchy
- Optional: Single accent word in muted color (dark red, muted gold) for emphasis — use at most once

**Texture & finish:**
- Very clean — minimal texture
- Optional very subtle noise grain at low opacity — just enough to feel printed
- Type edges: Sharp and crisp — this is the one style where precision is correct
- No paper grain, no ink bleed, no misregistration

**Subject transformation logic:**
No subject image. The copy provided by the user IS the subject. The typographic treatment of that copy — its scale, weight, line breaks, and spatial tension — is the entire design. Before assembling the prompt, determine the optimal line breaks for the display copy: each break should create rhythm, emphasis, or surprise. A four-word phrase broken as two words per line reads differently than three words then one. Choose the breaks deliberately and specify them explicitly in the prompt. The line breaks are an editorial decision, not a layout accident.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like someone had a very strong opinion and printed it on a wall. Authoritative without being aggressive. The kind of thing a design studio frames in their lobby and means it.

## Style 9 — Dark Fashion Editorial

**Mood:** Cinematic, mysterious, high-stakes. Feels like a scene from a film you want to be in.
**Best for:** Fashion launches, beauty campaigns, luxury product releases, portrait-forward campaigns, music artist profiles.
**Reference:** "The Sculpt Blazer" Larana Inc. fashion editorial poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Full-bleed moody photography — deep, saturated background tones (crimson, noir black, forest, ink), heavy film grain, slight lens blur or glow at subject edges. Dramatic directional light — partial obscuring of the face or form is intentional mystery. Typography as a structured grid overlay: bold condensed block on one side, smaller metadata on the other. Feels like an A24 film poster crossed with a luxury fashion campaign.

**Subject treatment:**
- Use the subject photo with full bleed — no cropping to a contained zone
- Apply heavy film grain and a strong color grade (deep warm red, noir black, or jewel tone)
- Introduce subtle lens effects: slight bloom at light sources, gentle blur at extreme edges, slight vignette
- Allow partial obscuring (shadow crossing features, soft lens blur on one side) — creates mystery
- Do not over-retouch — texture and imperfections are authentic
- The subject should look like a film still, not a product shot

**Composition rules:**
- Full-bleed photography — color grade extends to all edges
- Typography occupies the lower 40% as a structured overlay, not a separate zone
- Left side: Primary title in large bold condensed block, 2–3 lines, left-aligned
- Right side: 2–3 metadata blocks in smaller type, right-aligned
- Small horizontal rule lines or circle marks separate metadata items
- Top: Brand name and product category — very small, flush left and right at very top edge
- Rounded corner frame on entire poster — subtle radius

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top left: Brand name — very small, light weight, all caps
- Top center: Optional small circle mark
- Top right: Product category or series — very small, light weight, all caps
- Lower left: Primary product/subject name in large bold condensed block, 2–3 lines stacked
- Lower right, stacked blocks: Product descriptor sentence, launch info with parenthetical date, attribute labels with values
- Bottom footer strip: Social handle, URL, CTA — small, evenly spaced with circle separators

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title (lower left): Letterforms that are significantly taller than they are wide — condensed proportion where character height is approximately 3–4x the character width. Stroke weight is heavy and uniform — no thick-thin variation. Characters sit very close together, almost touching. The overall block of text feels like a vertical architectural element anchoring the lower left corner. White fill against dark photo. 2–3 lines stacked.
- Metadata labels (lower right): Same condensed construction at very small scale — roughly 8–10% of the primary title height. All caps, tracked open. Light weight rather than heavy — the contrast with the bold title is weight-based, not size-based alone.
- Metadata values: Same small scale as labels but heavy weight — the label is light, the value is bold. Creates alternating rhythm within the metadata column.
- Descriptor sentence: Very small scale, regular or light weight — the only text that reads at a comfortable reading size. Adds warmth and approachability to the otherwise architectural layout.
- Top labels: Same family as everything else, extremely small, very light weight, tracked wide. These are barely there — functional, not decorative.
- Critical: The condensed proportion of the title block is the typographic signature. Normal-width letterforms do not create the architectural weight this style requires. The title must feel like a structural column, not a label.

**Color palette:**
- Background: Deep photographic tone — deep crimson `#4A0A0A`, noir black `#0A0A0F`, forest ink `#0A1A14`, midnight blue `#0A0A2A`
- Typography: White `#FFFFFF` throughout
- Grain and grade: Warm shift for fashion/luxury, cool shift for beauty/editorial
- No bright accent colors — the subject's own highlights are the only warm notes

**Texture & finish:**
- Heavy film grain — second most grain-forward style after Chromatic Blur
- Subtle color grade applied to full image for cohesion
- Slight vignette at all four corners
- Lens bloom at practical light sources
- Rounded corner frame — subtle radius, feels like a printed card

**Subject transformation logic:**
Keep the photograph but apply three transformations: (1) color grade — push the background tones toward deep crimson, noir black, or jewel tone using a strong LUT-style color shift that unifies the entire image; (2) grain — add heavy film grain across the full image surface, visible at normal viewing distance; (3) mystery — introduce intentional partial obscuring of the face or form through shadow, lens blur on one side, or a hand/object crossing in front. The subject should look like a film still extracted from a movie that hasn't been made yet. Do not retouch skin or smooth surfaces — imperfections are authentic.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like you walked into a room and someone important was there. High stakes. The kind of campaign image that makes you stop scrolling. Cinematic confidence without trying.

## Style 10 — Contemporary Swiss / Museum

**Mood:** Intellectual, considered, quietly confident. Feels like an invitation from a place that doesn't need to impress you.
**Best for:** Art exhibitions, cultural festivals, gallery openings, design conferences, museum events.
**Reference:** Studio Air spring collection exhibition poster / Art Festival poster.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Contemporary interpretation of Swiss International Style. Warm off-white background. Massive lowercase neo-grotesque type at the top, bleeding toward edges. One photograph inset as a contained rectangular block — treated as document, not hero image. Small justified body copy. Tiny plus marks or 4-pointed stars as the only ornamentation. Intellectual, museum-adjacent. Feels like something MoMA would mail you.

**Subject treatment:**
- Convert the subject photo into a contained rectangular inset — cropped to horizontal or square format
- Apply subtle desaturation — reduced color intensity, not full black-and-white
- Photo placed in the middle-lower zone, not full-bleed
- Treat the photo as a document or specimen — objective, not atmospheric
- Optional: subtle grain or halftone on the photo surface

**Composition rules:**
- Warm off-white background, full bleed, no border
- Primary display type at top: massive, lowercase, left-aligned, taking up 30–40% of poster height
- 2–4 small plus or 4-pointed star marks at intentional grid intersections — sparse, precise
- Body copy block: 3–5 lines, small, between title and photo
- Photo: contained rectangle, full width or slightly inset, middle-lower zone
- Footer: key details in small type, left and right aligned

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top: Primary name in massive lowercase display, 1–2 lines, left-aligned — fills the width
- Between title and photo: Body copy — descriptive sentences, small justified or left-aligned text
- Scattered (2–3 instances): Small plus marks at grid intersections
- Middle-lower: Photo inset, contained rectangle
- Bottom left: Hours, dates, or admission — bold small + regular small alternating
- Bottom right: Website or social handle — small, right-aligned
- Bottom center (optional): One small plus mark

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Letterforms with uniform stroke weight — no thick-thin variation. Characters are moderately wide, upright, and geometric. The stroke weight is heavy enough to feel substantial but not so heavy that counters collapse — the interior spaces of letters like 'o', 'e', 'a' remain open and airy. Lowercase only — the absence of capitals signals intellectual confidence, not casualness. Characters are slightly wider than a typical grotesque — between normal and extended proportion. The display type fills the width of the poster at large scale: a two-word title should span edge to edge, with each character approximately 15–20% of the poster width. Near-black fill on warm off-white background. This is the typographic signature of the style: it should feel inevitable, not decorated.
- Body copy: The same typeface family at its lightest available weight — thin strokes, open spacing, small scale (approximately 3–4% of poster height). Justified or left-aligned in a contained column. The visual impression is of a precise, considered block of information — not a paragraph of flowing prose.
- Footer details: Alternating bold and regular weight within the same small scale — "OPENING HOURS:" in bold, "10AM – 10PM" in regular. This weight alternation creates rhythm without changing size.
- Plus marks / star marks: Simple geometric forms — perfectly symmetrical, crisp, exactly the same stroke weight as the body copy. They function as grid markers, not decoration.
- Critical: The massive display type and the tiny body copy must coexist without anything in between. There is no medium-sized type in this style. The scale jump is abrupt and intentional — it creates the intellectual tension that defines the aesthetic. Any medium-scale text breaks the system.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Warm off-white `#F0EDE8` or pale parchment `#EDE8E0`
- Primary type: Near-black `#111111` — not pure black
- Plus/star marks: Same near-black
- Photo: Desaturated or subtle duotone, mid-tones
- Optional single accent: One element in muted institutional color — slate blue, moss, or warm terracotta — used for one word or one detail only

**Texture & finish:**
- Very clean — minimal texture on the layout
- Subtle paper grain at low opacity on background
- Photo may have gentle grain
- Plus marks: crisp, precise, vector-sharp
- No ink bleed, no misregistration — this style values precision

**Subject transformation logic:**
Convert the photograph into a contained rectangular inset — crop it to a horizontal or near-square format and treat it as a document or specimen, not a hero image. Apply desaturation (reduce color intensity by approximately 70%) and a subtle duotone or grain treatment so it reads as an archival or printed photograph. Place it in the middle-lower zone of the poster, not full-bleed. The photograph should feel like evidence or illustration, not the focal point. The massive display typography at the top is the focal point. If the photo is drawing more attention than the type, it's too prominent.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like an invitation from somewhere that doesn't need to impress you. Considered, precise, and completely sure of itself. The kind of design that gets better the longer you look at it.

## Style 11 — Blueprint Core

**Mood:** Precise, witty, engineered. Feels like a product manual that became art.
**Best for:** Tech products, food/object deconstructions, engineered goods, explainer campaigns, maker culture.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Blueprint Design. Isometric typography posters, Vancouver Maker Faire, exploded ramen schematics.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Technical drawing aesthetic borrowed from engineering workshops and architect offices. Hyper-detailed annotation language — dimension arrows, measurement labels, exploded views, cross-section diagrams, isometric projections — applied to any subject as pure graphic play. Monochromatic: white linework on deep blue, or blue linework on white/cream. Every element feels documented and considered. Over-explaining is the aesthetic — the subject becomes more interesting because it has been taken apart and labeled.

**Subject treatment:**
- Deconstruct the subject into an exploded or isometric illustration — components pulled apart and floating in space with lines connecting them back to the whole
- All illustration: clean single-weight linework, no fills except the background color
- Add dimension arrows, measurement annotations, and component labels to every major part
- Include at least one cross-section or cutaway view showing interior detail
- Apply consistent stroke weight throughout — any variation breaks the blueprint illusion
- Subject should feel like it has been placed on a drafting table and studied

**Composition rules:**
- Background: solid deep blue OR white/cream — never photographic
- All elements rendered in a single contrasting color (white on blue, or blue on white)
- Isometric or orthographic projection — no perspective distortion
- Title block in one corner (bottom right traditionally) with title, date, scale notation
- Grid of fine lines visible across the entire background — the drafting paper grid
- Generous space around the main illustration — let the technical elements breathe

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Center or upper-center: Main exploded/isometric illustration of the subject
- Throughout illustration: Component labels in small monospaced type with leader lines pointing to each part
- Bottom right: Title block — primary title, subtitle, date, version number in structured grid
- Top or sides: Optional dimension annotations and scale indicators
- Scattered: Measurement arrows with numbers, callout circles with letters referencing a legend

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- All text: Monospaced letterforms — every character occupies exactly the same horizontal width. The strokes are uniform weight, thin to medium, with no thick-thin variation. Terminals are cut flat at 90 degrees. Characters feel like they were typed on a typewriter or output from a plotter. This is engineering annotation type, not display type.
- Primary title (in title block): Same monospaced construction at larger scale — approximately 3x the annotation text height. All caps. Still monospaced — does not switch to a display font for the title.
- Dimension numbers and labels: Same monospaced at very small scale — annotation size, precise, clinical.
- Leader lines: Single-weight lines with a small arrowhead or dot at the point of connection. The line weight matches the illustration linework exactly.
- Critical: Every single character across the entire poster must be monospaced. No mixing of font styles. The visual uniformity of monospaced type is what makes the blueprint illusion convincing.

**Color palette:**
- Version A (Classic Blueprint): Deep blueprint blue `#1A3A6A` background, white `#FFFFFF` linework and type
- Version B (Technical White): White `#FFFFFF` or warm cream `#F5F0E8` background, blueprint blue `#1A3A6A` linework and type
- Single color only — no accent colors, no gradients
- Grid lines: same color as linework at 20–30% opacity

**Texture & finish:**
- Fine grid overlay across entire background (like graph paper or drafting paper)
- Optional: very subtle paper or linen texture at low opacity
- All lines crisp and precise — no roughness, no hand-drawn variation
- No grain, no blur, no photographic texture

**Subject transformation logic:**
Do not use the photograph directly. Translate the subject into a technical illustration: an isometric or orthographic line drawing that deconstructs the subject into its component parts, pulled apart in space with connection lines between them (an exploded view). Every line must be the same weight — uniform stroke throughout. Add dimension arrows with measurements, numbered callout labels for each component, and at least one cross-section view. Apply zero fill — white linework only on the blue background, or blue linework only on the white background. The subject should look like it was drawn by an engineer preparing a manufacturing specification, not by a designer.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like the most considered product description ever made. Witty and precise in equal measure. The kind of poster that rewards reading every small label — and they should all say something worth reading.

## Style 12 — Archival Trinket

**Mood:** Nostalgic, curated, quietly personal. Feels like someone's most meaningful drawer emptied onto a museum sheet.
**Best for:** Lifestyle brands, wellness, personal fashion, small businesses, seasonal campaigns, object-based storytelling.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Trinket Design. Museum catalog sheets, "what's in my bag" Pinterest aesthetics, scrapbook object arrangements.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Everyday objects elevated to artifact status through careful curation and presentation. Objects arranged in neat grids or organic clusters on neutral backgrounds — scanned silhouettes, top-down photographs, or clean illustrations with museum-style numbering and labels. Part still life, part scrapbook, part specimen sheet. The logic is catalog: every object is numbered, named, and given equal visual weight. Deeply nostalgic, tactile, and emotionally specific.

**Subject treatment:**
- Isolate 6–12 objects related to the subject/theme — specific, personal, thematically connected items
- Each object: clean silhouette against the background with a subtle drop shadow (soft, not dramatic)
- Arrange in a grid with consistent spacing OR in an organic cluster that still feels considered
- Add small numbered labels (①②③ or 01, 02, 03) next to each object
- Optional: small descriptive caption beneath each number in tiny type
- Objects should be specific and telling — not generic. A coffee brand: specific cup, specific bean variety bag, a worn spoon, a handwritten recipe card

**Composition rules:**
- Neutral background: warm cream, soft gray, or aged white — never bright or saturated
- Objects arranged so negative space between them is roughly equal — breathing room is essential
- One object may be slightly larger or more central as the hero item — others support it
- Border or frame: thin ruled line inset from edges, or no border at all
- Title block: either integrated as a header or very small at the bottom
- Overall feel: considered and quiet — a museum display case, not a cluttered table

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top or top-left: Collection title or brand name — small, light weight, understated
- Scattered near objects: Numbered labels (① ② ③) in tiny type, each with a short descriptor on the next line
- Bottom center or bottom right: Date, edition, or series label — very small
- Optional bottom: One sentence description of the collection — what unifies these objects
- No large display type — all copy is small, quiet, deferential to the objects

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- All text: Light or thin weight letterforms — strokes so fine they feel like they were printed with a dry pen. Moderate letter-spacing, not tightly set. Characters are upright, not italic. The overall impression is of a museum or catalog label — informative, neutral, unobtrusive.
- Collection title: Same thin letterforms at slightly larger scale — approximately 2x the label text. Still modest — this is not a display headline.
- Numbers/labels: Monospaced or near-monospaced thin type at very small scale. Could be circled numbers (①) or plain numerals with periods.
- Critical: There is no display type in this style. Everything is small and considered. The objects do the visual work — the type serves them, never competes.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Warm cream `#F5F0E8`, soft warm gray `#E8E4DE`, or aged white `#F0EDE8`
- Object silhouettes: Natural object colors, slightly desaturated — muted, not vivid
- Type: Dark warm brown-black `#2A2018` or deep gray `#333333`
- Optional accent: One object in a slightly more saturated color as the hero — just one
- No pure white, no pure black, no saturated accent colors

**Texture & finish:**
- Subtle paper grain across the background
- Objects: slight desaturation and a very soft shadow beneath each
- Optional: aged paper or linen texture overlay at very low opacity
- Type: slightly soft edges — feels printed, not digital
- No film grain, no blur — everything reads clearly

**Subject transformation logic:**
Do not use the photograph as a full-bleed image. Instead, isolate the subject and 5–11 additional objects thematically related to it. Photograph or render each object individually against a neutral background with a soft overhead light that creates a gentle shadow beneath. Apply slight desaturation (reduce color by ~30%) to all objects. Arrange the full set in a considered grid or organic cluster on the neutral background with consistent spacing. Add a small numbered label (① ② ③) next to each object. The objects must be specific and personally meaningful — not generic props. Generic objects destroy this style.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like someone opened their most meaningful drawer and arranged it for you to see. Personal without being private. The kind of image that makes people say "I didn't know I needed this" and then immediately think about what their version would look like.

## Style 13 — Punk Grunge

**Mood:** Rebellious, raw, alive. Feels like it was photocopied three times and wheat-pasted over something else.
**Best for:** Music releases, streetwear, activist campaigns, underground events, brands rejecting polish.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Punk Grunge. DIY zine culture, xerox art, 1970s–80s punk flyer tradition, torn collage aesthetics.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
DIY print culture at maximum intensity. Xerox grain, torn paper edges, distressed textures, hand-cut collage, overexposed photography, handwritten or rubber-stamp type mixed with aggressive display type. Nothing is clean, nothing is smooth, nothing is centered unless deliberately so as an ironic statement. The message is: this was made by human hands under urgency. Every element looks like it could be peeled off a telephone pole.

**Subject treatment:**
- Apply heavy grain, overexposure, or xerox-style high-contrast treatment to any subject photo
- Push contrast to near black-and-white — most midtones are lost
- Optional: halftone dot pattern applied over the subject (large dots, visible at normal viewing distance)
- Torn or rough-cut edges where the subject meets the background — not clean silhouettes
- Layer the subject behind or beneath type elements — text overlaps the image aggressively
- Multiple exposure or photocopy artifacts welcome — doubling, ghost edges, ink smear

**Composition rules:**
- No single dominant compositional logic — elements feel assembled under urgency
- Mix of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal text orientations
- Torn paper shapes as background zones or dividers
- Heavy use of negative space in unexpected places alongside areas of total density
- Borders: either none, or a rough hand-drawn rectangle in marker weight
- Overall: it should look like someone assembled this on a floor with scissors and a photocopier

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Primary title: Large, aggressive, could be anywhere — top, center, or broken across two areas
- Subtitle: Different orientation from the title — if title is horizontal, subtitle is diagonal or vertical
- Scattered: Short phrases, words, or numbers at varied scales and angles — not aligned to a grid
- Optional handwritten annotation: One or two words scrawled by hand in a contrasting color
- Bottom or anywhere: Date, location, handle — in rubber-stamp style or very small distressed type
- No consistent margin or padding — elements bleed to or past the edge

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Extremely heavy letterforms — stroke weight is 30–40% of total character height. Characters are wide, solid, and dense. No interior space visible in rounded letters — the counter is nearly or completely filled by the stroke weight. The letterforms feel like they were cut from black paper. Alternatively: a mix of two incompatible type styles in the same line — one heavy slab, one handwritten — creating deliberate typographic tension.
- Secondary type: Handwritten letterforms — uneven stroke width, characters that vary in height slightly, baseline that rises and falls. Feels like it was written quickly with a marker or brush.
- Distressed treatment on all type: edges are rough, ink bleeds slightly, individual characters may have missing pixels or grain artifacts — not perfectly rendered.
- Rubber stamp style for detail text: slightly misaligned, ink-saturated at center and fading at edges, slight rotation off perfectly horizontal.
- Critical: No clean digital type anywhere. Every letterform should show evidence of being made or reproduced by hand or machine — grain, smear, bleed, or roughness.

**Color palette:**
- Base: Black `#0A0A0A` or very dark ground, OR stark white/newsprint `#F5F0E2`
- Primary type and illustration: High contrast to base — white on black or black on white
- Accent: One saturated color used sparingly — signal red `#CC1A1A`, acid yellow `#F5D800`, or safety orange — for one word, one shape, or one element only
- Optional: Overprint effect — two colors that weren't meant to align creating a third color where they overlap
- No gradients, no muted pastels — maximum contrast everywhere

**Texture & finish:**
- Heavy xerox grain across the entire image — grain so pronounced it reads as a design element
- Torn paper edges on major shapes — irregular, fibrous, not cut cleanly
- Ink bleed and smear on type edges
- Halftone dot pattern on photographic elements — large dots, visible pattern
- Optional: fold marks or crease lines across the image as if it had been folded and unfolded
- No smooth surfaces anywhere

**Subject transformation logic:**
Apply a xerox/photocopy simulation to any uploaded photograph: push contrast to near black-and-white (eliminate most midtones), apply heavy grain that reads as a design element not background noise, add a large-dot halftone pattern over the image. The subject should look like it was photocopied three times on a machine that was running low on toner. All photographic smoothness, gradients, and color information should be destroyed. Layer this treated image behind type elements — text runs over and through the image aggressively. Torn paper shapes may be composited in to create zones.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like it was made under urgency with whatever was available. Photocopied, cut, glued, and wheat-pasted on a wall before anyone could stop it. Alive in a way that no polished design can be.

## Style 14 — Future Medieval

**Mood:** Mythic, sacred, darkly ornate. Feels like a cathedral rebuilt inside a server room.
**Best for:** Nightclub events, music releases, luxury fashion, gaming brands, dark creative agencies, NYE events.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Future Medieval. Gothic heraldry + digital chrome effects, blackletter type with neon glow, illuminated manuscript patterns rendered in holographic material.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Medieval visual vocabulary — blackletter type, heraldic crests, illuminated manuscript borders, gothic arches, mythic creatures, candles, ribbons, banners — fused with digital-age rendering: chrome reflections, iridescent surfaces, neon inner glows, and dark electronic event poster energy. The sacred and the synthetic. Feels like a nightclub that was consecrated as a chapel, or a fashion brand that worships at an altar.

**Subject treatment:**
- Render the subject in the visual language of medieval sacred objects — gilded, ornate, reverential
- Apply chrome or iridescent surface treatment to key elements — reflective, holographic, shifting
- Surround the subject with heraldic or manuscript-style border decorations: knotwork, vine ornaments, shield shapes, banner ribbons
- Optional: place the subject within a gothic arch or illuminated manuscript frame
- Dark, rich background — deep black, midnight purple, or dark jewel tone
- Candle glow, torch light, or inner neon light emanating from the subject as the light source

**Composition rules:**
- Strong vertical symmetry — heraldic compositions are almost always bilaterally symmetrical
- Subject centered, elevated — placed at the top center or center of the composition as an object of veneration
- Decorative border elements frame the entire poster — corner ornaments, side vine work, bottom heraldic flourishes
- Rich density — every area of the poster has some ornamental presence
- Title integrated into a banner or ribbon element, or set in blackletter that reads as part of the decoration

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top: Event name or primary title in large blackletter or gothic display — centered, could be set on a banner ribbon shape
- Below title: Heraldic crest or shield element as a visual separator
- Center: Subject — the focal image or illustration, centrally placed
- Mid-poster sides: Supporting heraldic elements (shields, creatures, banners) flanking the subject symmetrically
- Bottom: Date, location, and supporting details — on a banner ribbon or in small gothic type
- Very bottom: Sponsor or series information in small type

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary title: Gothic blackletter letterforms — each character built from diamond-shaped strokes meeting at sharp angles, with dramatic thick-thin variation. The thick strokes are approximately 5–6x the width of the thin hairline strokes. Ascenders and descenders are elongated. The overall impression is of letterforms chiseled from stone or drawn with a broad-nib pen held at a fixed angle. Characters are compressed horizontally — tall and narrow. May include chrome or iridescent surface treatment on the letterforms themselves.
- Secondary / detail type: Either very small blackletter at fine scale, OR a contrasting modern thin sans-serif — the contrast between gothic blackletter and clinical modern sans is a deliberate design signature of contemporary Future Medieval work.
- Ornamental letterforms: Initial capitals may be fully illustrated — embedded in decorative borders, with vine work growing from the serifs.
- Critical: The blackletter must have visible thick-thin stroke contrast. Uniform-weight gothic letterforms do not achieve this aesthetic. The drama of the style lives in the stroke weight variation.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Near-black `#0A0008`, midnight purple `#1A0A2A`, or deep crimson `#2A0A0A`
- Heraldic elements: Deep jewel tones — burgundy `#6A1A2A`, forest green `#1A3A1A`, royal blue `#1A1A5A`
- Chrome/iridescent accents: Holographic gradient — shifts from gold to pink to blue depending on position. Applied to key elements only.
- Type: Off-white `#F5F0E8` or pale gold `#D4B870` — aged parchment tones
- Inner glow: Soft warm candlelight `#F5C870` emanating from practical light sources within the composition
- No flat bright colors — everything is deep, saturated, and rich

**Texture & finish:**
- Aged parchment or dark velvet texture across background
- Chrome/iridescent finish on select elements — holographic, shifting
- Inner glow on candles, crystals, or light sources — soft, warm
- Gold or silver foil effect on heraldic border elements
- Slight grain across the full image — aged, not digital-smooth

**Subject transformation logic:**
Render the subject as a sacred or reverential object — elevate it visually as if it were being presented at an altar. Apply a chrome or iridescent surface treatment to the subject itself: reflective, holographic, shifting colors (gold to pink to blue). Surround it with heraldic border decorations specific to the subject's world (shields, ribbons, knotwork, mythic creatures). The background should be near-black with deep jewel-tone gradients. A warm candlelight or torch-like glow should emanate from the subject as the light source. The overall rendering should feel like medieval illuminated manuscript technique applied to digital chrome materials.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel sacred and slightly dangerous at the same time. The kind of poster that looks like it belongs in both a cathedral and a club. A viewer should feel like they're being invited into something exclusive and ancient.

## Style 15 — Surveillance Design

**Mood:** Cold, precise, watchful. Feels like you've been seen by a system that doesn't care about you.
**Best for:** Tech campaigns, editorial design, conceptual art projects, identity and privacy themes, fashion with edge.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Surveillance Design. CCTV stills, facial recognition UI, biometric HUDs, thermal imaging, machine vision overlays.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Machine vision aesthetic extracted from security infrastructure. CCTV feed frames, bounding boxes around faces and bodies, facial recognition grids, biometric data overlays, thermal imaging color maps, crosshairs, system log typography, timestamp HUDs. The palette is cold and utilitarian: monochrome with occasional functional color (green for recognized, red for flagged, blue for data). Everything feels like UI that was designed for observation, not for aesthetics — and that functional coldness is what makes it visually striking when applied to design.

**Subject treatment:**
- Place the subject inside a CCTV-style frame or bounding box — a rectangle drawn in the accent color with corner markers only (not full sides), or a full rectangle with a label above
- Apply facial recognition or object recognition overlays: landmark dots on key features, measurement lines between them, confidence percentage label
- Optional: thermal imaging color treatment — dark blue/purple for cool areas, bright yellow/orange/white for warm areas
- Timestamp, camera ID, and scene number overlaid in the corner(s)
- Slight compression artifact or low-resolution pixelation treatment on the subject photo
- Subject should feel documented, not glamorized

**Composition rules:**
- Dark background — black or very dark gray — like a monitor in a dark room
- Subject placed within a structured frame or grid system — never floating freely
- Multiple overlapping UI elements: bounding boxes, crosshairs, data readouts, progress bars
- Strict grid logic — all UI elements align to an invisible grid
- Monochrome with one functional accent color: safety green `#00FF41`, warning red `#FF2200`, or data blue `#00AAFF`
- Feels like a screenshot of a real system — not a designed poster about surveillance

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top bar: Camera ID, location label, timestamp — small monospaced type, left and right aligned
- Over subject: Recognition bounding boxes with label above (e.g. "FEMALE MUSE", "TARGET", "SUBJECT A")
- Scattered data points: Confidence percentages, measurement readouts, system status labels
- Side panels (optional): Data columns — lists of attributes, measurements, status flags in small monospaced type
- Bottom bar: Scene number, date, system version, operator ID — same monospaced treatment as top bar
- No traditional "title" placement — all copy is functional data, not design copy

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- All text without exception: Monospaced letterforms — every character the same width. Stroke weight is thin to medium, uniform throughout. No thick-thin variation. No serifs. Characters look like terminal output or system font — OCR-adjacent, functional, inhuman.
- Bounding box labels: Same monospaced type in the accent color (green, red, or blue). All caps. Very small scale relative to the bounding box.
- Data readouts: Same monospaced at even smaller scale — 2–3% of poster height. Dense information.
- Timestamp: Same monospaced at small scale — top corners, functional placement.
- Critical: There must be zero design intent visible in the typography. All type should look like system output. Any decorative or expressive letterform destroys the illusion.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant (background): Near-black `#0A0A0A` or very dark gray `#111116`
- Subject: Monochrome or slightly desaturated — cold, drained of warmth
- Primary accent: Safety green `#00FF41` (recognition confirmed), warning red `#FF2200` (flagged/alert), or data blue `#00AAFF` (information/tracking) — pick ONE and use consistently
- All UI elements: accent color only — no mixing of accent colors
- Optional: thermal imaging treatment substitutes the monochrome palette entirely with heat-map colors (deep blue → purple → red → orange → white)

**Texture & finish:**
- Subtle CRT scan line overlay — horizontal lines at 2–3px intervals, very low opacity
- Slight compression artifact grain on the subject photo
- Optional: a faint vignette on the subject as if from a security camera lens
- UI elements: crisp, no blur, pixel-perfect
- No paper grain, no film grain — this is a digital system aesthetic

**Subject transformation logic:**
Keep the photograph but apply machine vision overlays: draw a bounding box around the primary subject using corner markers in the accent color (green, red, or blue), add a label above the box in monospaced type (e.g. "FEMALE MUSE", "TARGET OBJECT", "SUBJECT A"), and include a confidence percentage below. Apply slight desaturation and compression artifact grain to the photograph itself so it looks like CCTV footage. Add a timestamp in the corner and a camera ID. The photograph should look like it was captured by a system that doesn't know it's being used for design.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel cold and precise — like being observed by something that doesn't care about you. Unsettling in a way that's also compelling. The clinical emptiness is what creates the visual tension.

## Style 16 — Signal Aesthetic

**Mood:** Kinetic, overstimulated, nostalgic for a future that felt possible. Feels like the intro sequence of a show you watched on Saturday morning.
**Best for:** Apparel, music releases, digital campaigns, podcast visuals, brands with Y2K nostalgia, energetic social content.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Signal Graphics. 90s TV broadcast idents, MTV bumpers, early CGI, RGB color separation, glitch letterforms, colliding shapes.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Visual language of 1990s television branding and broadcast design — the era of channel idents, music channel bumpers, and early CGI title sequences. Animated shapes that appear to be mid-motion: colliding, mutating, exploding. RGB color channels separated and offset so red, green, and blue versions of each element are slightly misaligned. Hyper-saturated primary and neon colors. 3D-looking objects rendered in the style of early CGI — slightly plastic, slightly wrong. Text that appears to be in motion — stretched, compressed mid-action.

**Subject treatment:**
- Render the subject in a stylized 3D or flat-3D treatment — isometric or slight perspective, plastic-looking surface
- Apply RGB channel separation to the subject: three slightly offset versions in red, green, and blue creating a glitch halo
- Subject appears mid-motion — blur trails, speed lines, or motion smear in the direction of implied movement
- Background: bright saturated gradient or solid field — aqua, electric blue, hot magenta — never neutral
- Optional: render subject as if it is breaking out of or shattering into its component shapes

**Composition rules:**
- Dense, energetic — multiple elements competing for attention simultaneously
- Strong diagonal movement lines and shape trajectories across the composition
- Multiple layers: background shapes, subject, foreground shape fragments, text
- No clear hierarchy — everything fights for attention with approximately equal energy
- Shapes: geometric — stars, circles, triangles, arrows, lightning bolts — scattered throughout
- Bleeds to all edges — no border, no frame, no breathing room

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Primary title: Large, appearing to stretch or compress mid-frame — as if filmed at the moment of transformation
- Title may be split across multiple lines with different scales suggesting motion toward or away from the viewer
- Supporting text: At varied angles, embedded within the shape field — no predictable placement
- Date/detail: Small, could be set in a TV-style lower-third bar with a background rectangle
- Overall: Copy placement suggests it was frozen mid-animation, not designed statically

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Letterforms with extreme weight — strokes approximately 25–35% of character height. Characters may appear stretched horizontally (wider than tall) or compressed vertically (taller than wide) to suggest motion. RGB channel separation applied: the same word appears three times in red, green, and blue, offset by 3–6px in different directions, creating a chromatic aberration halo. The combined effect looks like the type is vibrating or moving.
- Secondary type: Same heavy letterforms at smaller scale with the same RGB treatment.
- Optional 3D extrusion: letterforms with a simple isometric extrusion in a darker shade — giving the impression of dimensional type from early 3D software.
- Motion blur type: some words may have a horizontal or diagonal blur applied — readable but smeared.
- Critical: Static, clean type destroys this style. All type must show evidence of motion, either through RGB separation, stretching, extrusion, or motion blur. The type should look like a frame extracted from an animation.

**Color palette:**
- Background: Bright saturated field — electric aqua `#00CCDD`, hot magenta `#FF00AA`, electric blue `#0044FF`, or neon lime `#AAFF00`
- Shapes and elements: Contrasting saturated primaries — red, yellow, blue, white — at full saturation
- RGB separation colors: Pure red `#FF0000`, pure green `#00FF00`, pure blue `#0000FF` — for the channel offset effect
- Typography: White with RGB separation treatment, or solid primary color
- No muted colors, no pastels, no neutrals — maximum saturation throughout

**Texture & finish:**
- RGB channel separation on all major elements — the defining texture of this style
- Optional: CRT scan line overlay at very low opacity
- Early CGI plastic surface on any 3D elements — slightly shiny, slightly wrong
- Motion blur on elements suggesting movement direction
- No paper grain, no film grain — this is broadcast digital

**Subject transformation logic:**
Render the subject in a stylized 3D treatment with a slightly plastic, early-CGI surface — think how objects looked in 1990s broadcast graphics: slightly too shiny, slightly too perfect, slightly wrong in a charming way. Apply RGB channel separation to the subject: create three slightly offset versions in pure red, green, and blue, overlapping to create chromatic aberration halos. Add motion blur or speed lines suggesting the subject is moving. Surround with geometric shapes (stars, circles, lightning bolts, triangles) in saturated primaries with white outlines. The entire composition should feel like it was frozen mid-animation.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like the Saturday morning cartoon intro you watched so many times you can still hear the music. Nostalgic for a specific kind of digital optimism that existed before everything became smooth and minimal. Loud in the best possible way.

## Style 17 — Frutiger Aero

**Mood:** Optimistic, clean, utopian. Feels like the default wallpaper of a world where technology delivered on every promise.
**Best for:** Tech brands, SaaS, digital products, retro-futurist campaigns, brands signaling clarity and optimism.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Frutiger Aero. Early 2000s Windows XP/Vista era, Nokia advertising, airport wayfinding, glossy UI design circa 2004–2010.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
The visual language of early 2000s digital optimism — glossy aqua and teal gradients, floating translucent globes and orbs, lens flares, lush grass and blue sky photography, bubble-like reflective typography, clean sans-serif wayfinding type. Originally from airport signage, tech branding, and interface design of the Windows XP/Vista era. Everything is glossy, clean, and promises a world of effortless digital connection. In 2026 this palette reads as warmly nostalgic — the future we hoped we were getting.

**Subject treatment:**
- Place the subject in or against a lush, saturated environment: bright blue sky with white clouds, green grass fields, or clean white studio with aqua gradients
- Apply a glossy, reflective surface treatment to the subject — slight specular highlight, slight reflection beneath
- Floating: the subject may hover slightly above its surface with a soft drop shadow — weightless, effortless
- Surround with characteristic Frutiger Aero elements: floating orbs/bubbles, translucent lens flares, swoosh marks, small decorative spheres
- Optional: subject embedded in or emerging from a translucent globe or lens element

**Composition rules:**
- Clean, airy, generous negative space — never crowded
- Background: gradient sky blue or clean white studio — always light, never dark
- Floating composition: elements feel gravity-light, hovering, effortless
- Decorative elements: swoosh marks, bubble clusters, translucent orbs — scattered but not dense
- Lens flares: 2–3 instances maximum, from light sources within the composition
- Overall: feels like a product launch from 2006 that you somehow want to buy right now

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Top center or top left: Brand or product name — clean, moderate scale
- Center: Subject, floating or hovering
- Below subject: Primary tagline or product descriptor — clean, light, optimistic language
- Supporting copy: 2–3 short benefit statements in small clean type, left-aligned or centered
- Bottom: URL, handle, or CTA in small clean type
- Decorative swoosh or orb elements fill negative space organically — not placed by grid logic

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Clean, rounded sans-serif letterforms — stroke weight is medium, consistent throughout, no thick-thin variation. Corners of letterforms have a slight rounding — not perfectly square terminals. Characters are moderately wide, upright. The overall impression is friendly, clear, and slightly soft. This is the typographic language of airport wayfinding and consumer tech — trustworthy, approachable, optimistic.
- Bubble/glossy treatment on title: The letterforms may have a glossy surface applied — a white specular highlight arc across the top of each character, creating the impression of inflated, shiny letterforms. This is the signature Frutiger Aero type treatment.
- Supporting text: Same rounded sans at lighter weight — thin strokes, same moderate width, very legible at small sizes.
- Critical: The rounded terminals and moderate stroke weight are essential. Heavy grotesques feel too aggressive. Geometric sans-serifs without rounding feel too cold. The softness and approachability of the letterform is what signals the era.

**Color palette:**
- Dominant: Sky blue gradient `#87CEEB` to `#4A9FD4`, OR clean white `#FFFFFF` to soft aqua `#E0F4F8`
- Accent: Aqua/teal `#00BBCC`, translucent white orbs, soft lime green `#88CC44`
- Typography: Deep teal `#006699` or white — never black
- Lens flares: White to pale yellow — soft, not harsh
- Orbs/bubbles: Translucent white with a slight aqua tint
- No dark backgrounds, no saturated brights — everything is clean, bright, and slightly soft

**Texture & finish:**
- Glossy surfaces — slight specular highlights on all objects and type
- Translucent elements — orbs, swooshes, lens flares with visible transparency
- Soft drop shadows beneath floating elements — diffused, light
- Lush photographic backgrounds (sky, grass) if used — saturated but not oversaturated
- No grain, no distress, no roughness — everything is smooth and optimistic

**Subject transformation logic:**
Keep the subject photographic but apply three specific treatments: (1) isolate it from its background completely; (2) apply a glossy specular highlight — a white curved reflection across the upper surface of the subject, making it look slightly inflated and shiny, like a product render from 2004; (3) make it hover slightly above its surface with a soft, diffused shadow beneath suggesting weightlessness. Surround it with floating translucent orbs, swoosh marks, and lens flares. Place it against a bright aqua-to-sky-blue gradient or lush green grass and blue sky background. Everything should feel clean, light, and optimistic.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like a promise — like the future is going to be clean and effortless and you're already living in it. The specific warmth of early 2000s technological optimism before anyone knew better. A viewer should feel slightly hopeful.

## Style 18 — Type Collage

**Mood:** Chaotic-good, expressive, kinetic. Feels like a zine page that went to art school.
**Best for:** Social content, streetwear brands, music releases, zine culture, editorial campaigns, bold brand moments.
**Reference:** Kittl 2026 trend — Type Collage. Chrome 3D letterforms, torn magazine type, mixed-scale typography collisions, Vietnamese poster design, 90s editorial maximalism.

### Parameters

**Aesthetic description:**
Typography treated as material rather than communication. Letters are torn, layered, rendered in 3D chrome or iridescent surfaces, mixed at wildly incompatible scales, collided and overlapped until they become texture. Multiple typefaces in the same composition — some flat, some dimensional, some hand-drawn, some mechanical. The page is covered: no negative space, or if there is negative space it is as deliberate as a percussion rest. Reading the type is secondary to experiencing it as a visual field.

**Subject treatment:**
- The subject is the typography — there may be no illustrative subject at all
- If a subject photo is included: crop aggressively, place partially, let type run over and through it
- Subject photo may be treated as a texture or background element rather than a focal point
- Type elements may be torn from their backgrounds like magazine cutouts — white jagged edges showing
- 3D chrome or iridescent letterforms may be the primary subject — floating, casting reflections

**Composition rules:**
- Full coverage — every area of the poster has something in it
- No consistent grid — elements overlap, rotate, scale independently
- At least three different type scales present simultaneously: very large (fills half the poster), medium, and very small
- At least two different typographic registers: e.g. heavy display + hand-drawn + small body
- Diagonal elements: at least one major text element is rotated 15–45 degrees
- Torn paper edges: at least one element has a torn or rough-cut edge treatment

**Layout logic — where copy lands:**
- Primary title: Takes up the most space — could be broken into individual letters scattered across the composition, or stacked so each letter fills its own horizontal band
- Secondary text: Overlaps with or runs perpendicular to the title
- Body/detail text: Small, tucked into gaps between larger elements — the negative space is used for information
- Date/handle: Could be set vertically up one edge, or hidden in a small block behind a larger element
- Decorative text: Words, fragments, letters used purely as visual texture — not meant to be read first

**Typography — visual geometry specification:**
- Primary display: Multiple simultaneous type styles — this is the defining rule. Must include at least two of: (a) extremely heavy grotesque with maximum stroke weight, (b) 3D extruded or chrome letterforms with visible dimensionality and reflection, (c) hand-drawn or painted letterforms with natural stroke variation, (d) torn magazine cutout type — each character from a potentially different source, varying in weight and size.
- Scale contrast: The largest type element should be at least 10–15x the height of the smallest type element in the same composition. This scale jump creates the collage energy.
- Rotation: Some elements rotated — diagonal type creates movement and breaks the grid.
- Texture on letterforms: Chrome type has specular highlights and reflections. Torn type has rough white paper edges. Hand-drawn type has visible brushwork. Each type element should feel like a different material.
- Critical: Uniformity destroys this style. If all the type is the same weight, same size, same treatment — it reads as bad layout, not Type Collage. The deliberate incompatibility of the elements is the design.

**Color palette:**
- No fixed palette — Type Collage is defined by juxtaposition, not color harmony
- Common approaches: (a) full color maximalism — every element in a different saturated color, (b) near-monochrome with one explosive accent, (c) black and white base with one color element (neon, chrome, or hand-colored)
- Chrome/iridescent letterforms: holographic gradient — shifts across the spectrum
- Background: could be a solid color, a torn paper texture, a photo fragment, or a color field — whatever serves the composition

**Texture & finish:**
- Torn paper edges on cutout elements — irregular, fibrous, white
- Chrome/iridescent surface on 3D letterforms — reflective, holographic
- Hand-painted texture on brush letterforms — visible bristle marks
- Halftone or grain on photographic elements
- Multiple textures coexisting — the material contrast is part of the aesthetic
- No consistent finish across the whole poster — each element has its own surface quality

**Subject transformation logic:**
The subject photograph, if provided, is raw material — not a hero. Crop it aggressively to an unexpected fragment, reduce it to near-monochrome, and place it partially behind or beneath type elements. The type itself is the primary visual subject. Use at minimum three incompatible typographic treatments simultaneously: extremely heavy grotesque at massive scale, 3D chrome or iridescent letterforms, and torn paper cutout type. Scale these radically — the largest type element should be 10–15x the height of the smallest. Rotate at least one major element 15–45 degrees. Add torn paper edges to at least one element. If it still looks like a designed poster, add more incompatibility.

**Output feeling:**
Should feel like something made by someone who knows every rule and is choosing to break all of them at once — and it works because the breaking is intentional. Chaotic-good. The kind of visual that people screenshot and save without knowing exactly why.
